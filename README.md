LinearRegression with 2 Variables challenge. 

##Challenge

The challenge for this video is to use scikit-learn to create a line of best fit for the included 'challenge_dataset'. Then, make a prediction for an existing data point and see how close it matches up to the actual value. Print out the error you get. You can use scikit-learn's documentation for more help. These weekly challenges are not related to the Udacity nanodegree projects, those are additional.
